             <p className="text-brown text-2xl w-3/4 mt-12">
             An electrifying psychedelic folk singer/songwriter with a resonance that far exceeds her years, Demi Casha’s particular brand of gum tree rock is quickly establishing her as one of Australia’s most exciting, emerging artists.

             December 2021 welcomed the release of Demi’s debut EP Return. Featuring a thumping 70s inspired sound that swings from Wild Woman, a heart wrenching salute to femininity to the upbeat and highly danceable Grow, Demi has earned regular rotation on ABC Sunshine Coast, Triple J Unearthed and 4ZZZ.

             With an impressive resume that includes opening for Karl S. Williams’ sell-out Brisbane show, the Sunshine Coasts dweller deliver refreshingly wild vocals sweeps over audiences like the ocean water that runs through her veins.

             The sheer verve and honesty of Demi Cashas performances have made her a regular fixture at blues and folk venues and festival stages including Caloundra Music Festival, The Bearded Lady, It’s Still A Secret and many more.

             Whether solo or performing with her band, you can hear a pin drop when Demi Casha takes the stage, but what follows is an emotional grenade that you’ll never forget.
