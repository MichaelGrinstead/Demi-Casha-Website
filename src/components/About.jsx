          ABOUT
        </h2>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-6">
          Demi Casha is an independent singer-songwriter from the Sunshine
          Coast, QLD, whose music dives deep into love, loss and life’s raw
          beauty. With a voice that’s equal parts strength and softness, Demi
          brings raw emotion and poetic storytelling to every song she writes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          Her sound blends indie-folk with what she calls “gum tree
          rock”—grounded in earthy acoustics, with flashes of grit and soul.
          Inspired by a wide span of artists, from Elvis Presley to Fleet Foxes,
          Sierra Ferrell to Patti Smith.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          Performing solo with a Maton dreadnought guitar, kick drum, and
          tambourine, her sets move from stripped-back stillness to
          rhythm-driven foot-stompers. Her live show is deeply honest and
          personal, shaped by in-the-moment banter and a strong sense of
          presence. What you see is what you get.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          She’s supported artists like Thelma Plum, C.W. Stoneking, Watty
          Thompson, and Busby Marou, and performed at major festivals including
          Falls Festival, Caloundra Music Festival, and Horizon Festival.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10 ">
          Demi is currently recording her next album with producer JB Paterson
          at Easy Machine Records—an emotional, raw and rootsy project that
          captures the next chapter of her evolving sound.
