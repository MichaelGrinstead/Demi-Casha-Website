          BIO
        </h2>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-6">
          Demi Casha is a singer-songwriter from the Sunshine Coast, QLD, whose
          music tells stories about love, loss, healing, and the journey in
          between. Her songwriting is emotional, unfiltered, and grounded in
          lived experience—carried by a voice that&apos;s both powerful and
          vulnerable. She sings to make sense of life, and in doing so, gives
          others permission to feel it all too.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          Her sound sits somewhere between indie-folk and what she
          affectionately calls &quot;gum tree rock&quot;—earthy, organic, and
          uniquely Australian in spirit. With influences as vast as Elvis
          Presley, Colter Wall, Fleet Foxes, Cat Clyde, and Patti Smith, Demi
          draws from a wide range of styles and eras to create something
          that&apos;s unmistakably her own. The through-line? Honesty, soul, and
          emotional weight.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          Demi performs solo, using a Maton dreadnought guitar, a kick drum, and
          tambourine to bring dynamic energy to her set. She carefully crafts
          the rise and fall of each performance—moving between stripped-back
          stillness and raw, rhythmic foot-stompers. Her live shows are full of
          character and connection. What you see is what you get, and the banter
          between songs is as real and unfiltered as the music.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          As a fully independent artist, Demi writes, records, books, and tours
          on her own terms. Her journey has seen her support Australian
          heavyweights like Thelma Plum, C.W. Stoneking, Watty Thompson, Hat
          Fitz &amp; Cara, and Busby Marou. She&apos;s played major festivals
          including Falls Festival, Caloundra Music Festival, Horizon Festival,
          and Woodfordia&apos;s Lake Gkula. In 2023, she independently booked
          and toured 20 shows along the East Coast in support of her single The
          River, and her work has been featured on Triple J Unearthed, 4ZZZ, and
          ABC Sunshine Coast.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brown text-xl mt-10">
          She recently released her most vulnerable single yet, The Journey
          (2025), and is currently in the process of recording a new album with
          producer JB Paterson at Easy Machine Records. It&apos;s shaping up to
          be a raw, emotionally honest body of work that captures Demi&apos;s
          growth, grit, and deepening connection to the artists and stories that
          continue to inspire her.

          &quot;Demi Casha&apos;s raw energy and delivery of vocals transcends
          back to the 70s, likened to Grace Slick from Jefferson Airplane... You
          can hear a pin drop when she takes the stage, but what follows is an
          emotional grenade you&apos;ll never forget.&quot; – Cara Robinson (Hat
